      <h1>Simple Password Manager</h1>
      <p>I wanted to learn more about cryptography and software development so I decided to make a password manager. It's for personal use and as a portfolio piece, however, if others want to use it I can't stop them.</p>
      <p>I do not recommend using Blind Tiger as I am not a cyber security professional. It's primarily a learning project where I can apply new knowledge of cryptography and software development.</p>
