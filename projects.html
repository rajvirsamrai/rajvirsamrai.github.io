      <h3>An Amateur Text Encryption Tool</h3>
      <p>Use Blind Tiger to encrypt and compress plain text quickly. You can choose from the available compression and encryption methods as wells as the order in which they're done.</p>
      <p>This project started because I wanted to learn about compression, cryptography, and software design patterns. I also wanted to confirm to myself I could program in Java.</p>
