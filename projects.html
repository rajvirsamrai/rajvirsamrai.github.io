      <h3>A Virtual Telegraph</h3>
      <p>Use Jorse to transmit dots and dashes to other Jorse users.</p>
      <p>Type in their ip & port to establish a connection and start pressing the key. You can hear incoming and outgoing beeps as well as see an accompanying indicator light.</p>
      <p>Jorse can handle multiple connections at once and will save incoming transmissions so you can play them when you're ready.</p>
      <p>This project started because I wanted to prove to myself I could program in Java. I also learned a lot about compression, encryption, networking, and software design.</p>

      <p>I had a website prior to this but I learned that it was quite terrible. I've remade this website from scratch taking inspiration from dukope.com</p>
